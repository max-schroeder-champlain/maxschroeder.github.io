## Overview

**FincrementalOS** is a incremental game where the player shoots fish from a submarine and interacts with a fake operating system to gain money, upgrade, and play various minigames to become stronger and gather even more fish.

## My Work

I spent my time working on various windows within the game. I've worked on the vacuum, email, data, settings, and shop windows. These were made using Unity's UI Toolkit, a tool that works similarly to web development. My goal was to make our windows feel like they should fit into an OS by keeping a consistent visual style and making them feel like they were built-in to the system itself. 

I also needed to make sure the windows were easy to use and understand, keeping buttons looking uniform and changing in color and size when the player hovers their mouse over it, helped testers get an easy grasp on the mechanics of the windows.
