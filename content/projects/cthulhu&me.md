## Overview

**Cthulhu & Me** is a third-person pseudo-roguelike where the player progresses through semi-random levels and unlocks new weapons along the way. 

## My Work

I worked both as a scrum master and designer on this project. As a scrum master I focused on helping my team learn and use agile as well as lead meetings and presentations.

As a designer, I worked primarily with enemy and weapon designs. I created and iterated on the rubber duck grenade, which grows bigger with each bounce it takes.
