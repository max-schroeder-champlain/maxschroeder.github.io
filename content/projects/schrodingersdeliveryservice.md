## Overview

In **Schrodinger's Delivery Service**, the player is presented with a box and must shake it to tell if a cat is inside or not. If there is a cat the player must deliver the box by throwing it at the house. If there is no cat, the player must throw the box off to the side to get a new one. Our game had three constraints: The game must contain physics components, the game must have a mechanic based on sound, the game must include a paradox.

## My Work

I led my team through the 48 hours we had to make this game. As a team, we decided on schrodinger's cat to be our paradox, which shaking and throwing the box to complete our sound and physics constraints. My work consisted of divying tasks and creating the shaking and throwing mechanic. Throughout my short time developing, I went through multiple iterations of the throwing mechanic. Cleaning it up to make a satisfying game mechanic.
